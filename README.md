# Welcome

Welcome to the section dedicated to vulnerabilities and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ([CVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common\_Vulnerabilities\_and\_Exposures)) that I have obtained during my research as a penetration tester. Here you will find detailed information on the various vulnerabilities I discovered, including their impact, exploitation steps, and advice on how to apply remediations.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me via one of the contact information available on [my website](https://nstsec.com).

Thank you for your interest in cybersecurity and happy browsing!
